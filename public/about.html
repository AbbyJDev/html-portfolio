<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I just recently graduated from UVU in May of 2022. I was an Elementary Education and a Psychology major. I double
  majored because I was interested in working with children, and was also interested in being able to understand how
  children's brains work in order to better help them accomplish their goals.
</p>

<p>I currently work at an escape room businees where I am a manager. I help my coworkers and employees complete their 
  jobs successfully in order to create an environment where their customers feel succesfull and helped. I also help my
  team continue to better thei customer service to create an experience as soon as a customer walks through the door
</p>

<p>I am hoping to now get  a job as an executive assistant because I still love to help others complete their jobs successfully
  and to create an environment for them to grow. I also have found a passion in online development and am interested in continuing 
  that passion and maybe getting a job that would allow me to work with others to create websites that fit all of their needs.
